# YLAStockMonitor

This application helps you monitor any product that you are looking for on the YoungLA website and lets you know if the product you are looking for is in stock or not with constant updates to your discord webhook server to keep you updated if it ever runs out of stock.

With npm pkg I have made it available for any user to use this app on MacOS, Linux, or Windows as they simply just need to paste all the links they want to monitor (separated by commas).# YLABot

# YLAStockMonitor

This application helps you monitor any product that you are looking for on the YoungLA website and lets you know if the product you are looking for is in stock or not with constant updates to your discord webhook server to keep you updated if it ever runs out of stock. For a new additional feature, you can checkout any number of your favorite products from YoungLA within seconds. 

## Monitor Bot

This bot is fairly easy to use as you simply run the `yla.js` file with the command `node yla.js`. But before that make sure that you have Node.js installed and if not that can be done by `npm install`. Make sure to install these to with the commands

`npm install got`
`npm install node-html-parser`
`npm install discord-webhook-node`

With `npm pkg` I have made it available for any user to use this app on MacOS, Linux, or Windows as they simply just need to paste all the links they want to monitor (separated by commas).
